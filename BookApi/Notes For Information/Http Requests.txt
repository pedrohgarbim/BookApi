HTTP Requests

HTTP GET:
Purpose: The GET request is used to retrieve data from a server at the specified resource. When you use GET, you are requesting the server to send back the information stored at that location.
Example: When you visit a webpage, your browser sends a GET request to fetch the HTML, images, and other files that make up the page.
Idempotence: GET requests are idempotent, meaning that making multiple identical GET requests will have the same effect as making a single request.

HTTP DELETE:
Purpose: The DELETE request is used to remove a specified resource from the server. When you send a DELETE request, the server will delete the resource at the specified URI.
Example: If you have an account on a website and decide to delete it, the request sent to the server would be a DELETE request.
Idempotence: DELETE requests are also idempotent, meaning that multiple DELETE requests for the same resource will result in the same outcome as the first request.

HTTP PUT:
Purpose: The PUT request is used to update or create a resource at the specified URI. If the resource already exists, PUT will update it. If it doesn’t exist, PUT can create it.
Example: If you are updating your profile information on a website, a PUT request would be used to send the updated data to the server.
Idempotence: PUT requests are idempotent as well, meaning sending the same request multiple times will have the same effect as sending it once.

HTTP POST:
Purpose: The POST request is used to send data to the server to create a new resource. Unlike PUT, POST does not guarantee idempotence; sending the same POST request multiple times may result in the creation of multiple resources.
Example: When you submit a form on a website, such as signing up for a newsletter, a POST request is used to send your data to the server.

CRUD Operations
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. 
These are the four basic operations that can be performed on any data storage system, 
such as a database. Here’s what each operation does:

Create: Adds a new record to the database. This is typically done using an HTTP POST request.
Read: Retrieves one or more records from the database. This is done using an HTTP GET request.
Update: Modifies an existing record in the database. This operation is performed using an HTTP PUT or PATCH request.
Delete: Removes a record from the database. This is done using an HTTP DELETE request.
CRUD operations are fundamental in web development, as they represent the basic functionalities required for managing data.
