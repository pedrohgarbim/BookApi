MVC always means model view conroller, and is a software design pattern or an 
architectural design pattern that we use to specify fow we send data from A to 
B, how the user navigates in our application that we use routes wich are defined 
from controllers, we create endpoints in controllers.

Inside of namespace MVC, we have a class called Controller base


 [ApiController] -> helps us with some core functionality
 ex: checking if we have errors inside of our server or in our controller
